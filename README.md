# Multitool
Using the Circuit Playground from Adafruit with vim and passwords


# Initialize
Enter in the VIM[] the uses you want vim to be used for

Enter in the PWD[] the passwords you want

# How-to
Using the slide switch, it will indicate which state you are on. When the LED's are green, you're on vim mode. When it the LED's are red, you're on password mode. The right button will move through the index of the arrays. The left button will print out the index you are on.

# Currently working on
I am making a way so the user can enter a sequence using the LED's and the buttons to print out the password
